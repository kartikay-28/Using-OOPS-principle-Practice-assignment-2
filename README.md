# Inventory Management System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by implementing a simple Inventory Management System in JavaScript. It includes `Product` and `Inventory` classes with functionalities for managing stock, selling products, and checking inventory levels.

## Features
- Create products with details like name, product ID, price, and stock.
- Add stock to products.
- Sell products and update inventory.
- Check the stock level of a product.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## How to Run
1. Copy the `inventory.js` file into a JavaScript runtime (Node.js or browser console).
2. Instantiate products and add them to inventory.
3. Call the `addStock`, `sellProduct`, and `checkStock` methods to simulate inventory operations.

## Example Output
```
Laptop added to inventory.
Phone added to inventory.
10 units added to Laptop. New stock: 10
5 units added to Phone. New stock: 5
3 units of Laptop sold. Remaining stock: 7
Not enough stock for Phone. Available stock: 5
Stock for Laptop: 7
Stock for Phone: 5
```

## Files Included
- `inventory.js` â†’ Contains the code implementation.
- `README.md` â†’ Project documentation.
- `output.txt` â†’ Logs of inventory operations.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
